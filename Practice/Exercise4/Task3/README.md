# Grid - Task 3

- Create a grid layout as seen in the screenshot
- The items should be arranged as columns
- As seen in the screencast, the size of the columns should be set accordingly
  when the amount of items changes
- You don't have to implement the dynamic item logic with the slider, this is
  for demo purposes only
